# Homework08-advanced-data
Home for lesson 8 - advanced data (SQL Alchemy)

This homework assignment was the least fun out of all of the assignments to date.  The files needed are all within the instructions folder.
The Jupyter Notebook submission is called "climate_Matt_working.ipynb."
The flask python file is in the same location and is called "app.py."

Note that I did not perform the optional portions of the homework this week.  I inserted a markdown in the notebook as a reference.
